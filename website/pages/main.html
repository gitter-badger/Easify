  <p>EasifyJS is a JavaScript library, created to make everything in JS easier and/or simpler. There are a lot of different pieces of functionality that just take too much code to do, distracting you from what really matters in your application. That's where EasifyJS comes in. It is a very lightweight and easy to use library that doesn't interfere with any of your other code. So no need to fully opt in or opt out (looking at you AngularJS).</p>
