***CONTRIBUTE***

Currently, there are 2 ways you can contribute to this project:

1. Submit an issue. When submitting an Issue please precede the title with some sort of category so it can easily be identified. Please make sure the category is all caps and is followed by a colon. (ex. WEBSITE:, BUG FIX:, FEATURE REQUEST:, etc.)

2. You can submit code via Pull Request. Before submitting a pull request, make sure you submit an issue to see if your idea is already being worked on by someone else. The list of issues is also a great place to start looking if you want to get into this project. If you want to start working on one of the issues, just submit a reply letting everyone know that you're planning on tackling it. This will keep a bunch of people from working on the same issues.

In the future, this section will be moved into a CONTRIBUTE.md file along with anything else deemed necessary. For now it's small enough to just leave here.


The website portion of this uses AngularJS so if things look a little odd in your forked version, it's because you need to run it in some sort of server. If you're using [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as your text editor, you should be good if you hit the preview button from website/index.html.
